# quattuor 

A minimalist, turn-based puzzle game inspired by _Onitama_, _Go_, and _Chess_. Built for the web, **quattuor** blends simple mechanics with procedurally generated puzzles for a deeply replayable experience.

Guide four elemental idols across the board to their respective shrines. Movement is dictated by a rotating sequence of spirits. As idols move, they exert lasting influence over the board â€” shaping the path forward and restricting future moves.

Trap an idol and lose the game. Lead all four to their shrines to achieve victory.
